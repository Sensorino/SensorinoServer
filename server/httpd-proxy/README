flask restful cors extension has issues with CORS.
It's easier to have eveything served from the same server/port

We use lighttpd that also provides a websocket "gateway/proxy" to
mosquitto mqtt server.  Up to at least lighttpd-1.4.35 mod_websocket
is not included in the vanilla source repository and needs patching
as detailed in https://github.com/nori0428/mod_websocket.  Good luck.

NOTE: we considered using nginx, but lighttpd websocket proxying was easier
We could use nginx : http://enable-cors.org/server_nginx.html
The nginx conf in this directoty can also be used (launch start.sh)
